1) attributes.js: margin, padding units for tab and mobile given default value 'px'. we're allowing users to choose different unit for different screensize (in margin/padding)
2) edit.js: fixed destructuring the attributes (more fix coming regarding this). margin padding implemented differently as these attribute's type changed to 'string' from 'number'. Minified styleObject/blockMeta as these are going to block's comment delemeter in database. 
3) editor.scss : css codes of dimensions-control's style.scss copied here because, those styles are only used in editor panel not in frontend.
4) inspector.js : margin padding attributes destructuring simplified. now we're not fallbacking 'tab' or 'mobile' margin-paddings in inspector panel as 'elementor' doing the same. So, I'm thinking it's unnecessary.
5) style.scss : typography styles moved to editor.scss as it's only needed in editor panel
6) src\myUtil\helpers.js : in 'generateTypographyAttributes' function added 'font size, line height and letterspacing unit' seperately for tab & mobile as I'll give option to choose different unit for different screen sizes. 
'generateTypographyStylesForEdit' funciton renamed to 'generateTypographyStyles' as I'll be using same pattern in both for frontend and editor page.
 in 'generateTypographyStyles' function attributes destructuring fixed and also destructured the 'font size, line height and letterspacing unit' attributes for tab & mobile. also used the different unit for different screensizes
 7) src\myUtil\dimensions-control\index.js : deleted  this folder's style.scss file and removed the import statement of the style.scss. 
 fixed markup : 'div' ending in wrong place
 8) src\myUtil\dimensions-control\style.scss : deleted this file as the styles here is working both in frontend and editor panel which is unnecessary. So, moved the styles in 'src/editor.scss' file.
 9) src\myUtil\dimensions-control\constants.js : few options of dimension control brought from constants rather than hard code typing in index.js pf dimension control.
 10) src\myUtil\dimensions-control\index.js : imported few things from constants rather than hard coding. fixed the  'font size, line height and letterspacing unit' attributes for tab & mobile. fixed the 'UnitControl' for seperate screensizes
